        "description": "Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive,negative or neutral. For example: “I am so happy today, good morning toeveryone”, is a general positive text. Basically, Sentiment Analysis is the task of identifying whether the opinion expressed in a text is Positive or Negative. Natural language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.",

        "description": "Chat-bots are computer programs that interact with users using natural languages. They use natural language processes for interaction. Chat-bot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Chat-bots are also used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chat-bots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simply scan for keywords within the input and pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a textual database. The chatbot is also known as chatter robots, are software agents that simulate human conversation via text or voice messages. One of the 1st and main goals of Chatbot had always been to resemble an intelligent human and make it hard for others to understand their real nature.",

A Face Recognition system has proven to be very beneficial in case of user identity verification in the recent past replacing the age-old authentication mechanisms like password protection or the One Time Passwords. In the last decade or so, we have seen a huge growth in the smart mobile industry for using face verification, and also numerous apps like Snapchat or Instagram which can put interesting filters on face. The ongoing research in this field has come up with a lot of scope in a wide range of applications, such as surveillance systems or law enforcement.",

Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph. It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.

The system analyzes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease asian output Disease Prediction is done by implementing the NaiveiBayes Classifier. Naive Bayes Classifier calculates the probability of the disease. With big data growth in biomedical and health care communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care. By using linear regression and decision tree we are predicting diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis. ",

This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch.SER is tough because emotions are subjective and annotating audio is challenging. We define a SER system as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect emotions embedded in them. Such a system can find use in a wide variety of application areas like interactive voice based-assistant or caller-agent conversation analysis.",

Mass-media affects the life of the general public and as it frequently occurs. There are few individuals that exploit these privileges. This prompts the creation of the news articles that are not totally evident or indeed, even totally false. People intentionally spread these counterfeit articles with the help of web-based social networking sites. The fundamental objective of fake news sites is to influence the popular belief on specific issues. The main goal of fake news websites is to affect public opinion on certain matters. Our aim is to find a reliable and accurate model that classifies a given news article as either fake or true.",

The genre of a movie supplies information on its overall content and has multiple values. Therefore, it should be well classified utilizing the characteristics of movies, without omissions in the database. The genre is one of the most important characteristics of a movie; by itself, it implies the overall contents of the movie. Above all, the genre has a substantial influence on the choice of movies. Therefore, because the genre is the primary characteristic of a movie that can provide general information about the movie, it should be classified without omission or error and used in automated services such as well-established databases.",
